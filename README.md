## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass for CSS styling
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework

### Continued development

In the future, I am going to utilize Sass much more in my projects to gain a better understanding of how it's used under
the hood with frameworks like Bootstrap. This includes folder structure, variables, and functions.
